# Group Project Data Mining

This project about using machine learning techniques in data mining includes; K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Classification Tree and Naive Bayes method to classify married variable in Determinants of Wages Data (CPS1985) Dataset.
In my work, I work on tree classification and Naive Bayes methods.
